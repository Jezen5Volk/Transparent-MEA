    Things to note: 
        -If you wish to enable all electrodes, replace stim.burst(...) with stim.burst_all(...);

        -If you wish to stimulate a selection of electrodes simultaneously, set e_dly to 0

        -If you want a longer delay before the program starts running, increase the delay in void setup()
