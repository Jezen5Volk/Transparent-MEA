# Transparent-MEA
The first (major) prototype for this project involved making a wafer design that contained 400 electrodes. The associated Altium design files and KLayout gds files are stored in the directory named *400 Electrode GDS files*.

The second prototype for this project involved expanding the design to cover the entire surface of a 4-inch wafer, as well as reducing the number of electrodes to maximize the size of bond pads. This permitted me to wire bond to the wafer easier. The associated Altium and KLayout files are located in the directory named *324 Electrode GDS files*.

The third prototype for this project shrank the design to 64 electrodes to permit the wafer and surrounding electronics to fit inside a 3.5 cm diameter petri dish. Additionally, wafer prototyping has reached a point where it is becoming necessary to make a custom stage of built in stimulation electronics for the wafer, to allow tissue on the device to be simultaneously stimulated and viewed optically. The directory named *64 Electrode Stimulation* contains the design files for both the wafer and the stimulation electronics.

The directory named *Altium Library* contains the schematic libraries containing the custom footprints and symbols made for components on this project.
